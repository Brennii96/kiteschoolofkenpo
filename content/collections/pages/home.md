    title: 'Why Learn Kenpo Karate?'
    content: |-
      At Kite School of Kenpo, we believe that studying martial arts is no longer a luxury – it’s a necessity. Our goal is to share Kenpo Karate with those who want to bring some deeper meaning into their lives. We try to teach people to work freely within the boundaries of their limitations, to learn how to think rather than what to think; to see opportunities rather than obstacles. Our students come from all walks of life – mums and dads; businessmen; military and law enforcement; experienced martial artists from all styles, as well as people studying martial arts for the very first time. You can learn more about the origins of Kenpo Karate here.

      Hear from our community. Read our reviews on [dojos.co.uk](https://dojos.co.uk/RedKiteKenpoMartialArts/Reviews.aspx) and explore our dedicated testimonials page.
