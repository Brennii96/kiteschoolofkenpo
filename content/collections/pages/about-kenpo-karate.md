            text: 'Kenpo Karate is an exciting, realistic self-defence art. Anyone of any age can learn and be effective in any situation. Kenpo Karate uses basic scientific principles to make it a logical and effective form of self-defence. It is an art that uses speed for power; fast hands, fists, back knuckles, elbows, palms, and chops are incorporated in multiple strikes to create a blur of speed. High kicks are rarely used; whilst they’re impressive to look at, we’ve found they’re highly ineffective in real-life situations. We use low targeted kicks, sweeps and buckles to unbalance and disabling an attacker. All instructors are black belts, DBS checked, and first aid is always available. Both adults and children are welcome.'

            text: 'Kenpo is a style of Karate developed in the west. The only difference between Kenpo and Kempo is in the translation of the Kanji to its English form. The words Kenpo and Kempo are both pronounced the same and both mean “Law of the Fist”. However, the more “traditional” forms of Kempo use the “Kempo” form, while the more non-traditional modern or contemporary versions use the term “Kenpo”.'

As they progress, the forms, and katas help them develop self-awareness and self-expression. Sparring is an exercise in which students test their skills, self-confidence, and self-control in a friendly competition among other classmates. It gives the opportunity to develop their reflexes and timing in a controlled environment while engaging in a sport activity.'
