bio: |-
  I was born and have spent my life living in Peterborough. Martial Arts has been the one constant throughout my life, beginning with Schoolboy boxing. Coming from a boxing family going back generations, I was encouraged to take it up. As a result of being knocked unconscious in the gym by a lad three years my junior, severely denting my pride, I decided boxing was not for me and subsequently joined a Karate club in Peterborough, in fact at that time the only one. The karate style was Shuokai / Shito Ryu which I practised from the 1970s through to the 1990s I ran one of a number of clubs for the national association in Peterborough. Unfortunately, due to internal politics, the association in Peterborough eventually collapsed and members went their separate ways.

  For several years I drifted from one martial art to another never able to settle taking part in styles as diverse as Judo, Tia Chi, Tae Kwon Do, Kung Fu, Akido and even Archery. Consequently, I became a Jack of all trades, Master of none. However, those years gave me lots of valuable experience and a great understanding and knowledge of many of the fighting arts.

  Then by accident I discovered Kenpo Karate, suddenly the flame inside me was reignited. The great thing about Kenpo is that it actively encourages practitioners to adapt techniques to suit their body type, (wonderful for an aching OAP like me) Kenpo employs linear and circular movements resulting in workable self-defence street techniques, where there are no rules. Kenpo isn’t sport oriented or competition based.

  The first time I attended a Kenpo class I immediately felt at home, pleasantly surprised at how friendly and approachable the Instructors and Students were, in contrast to the strict regimented atmosphere of the traditional Japanese styles I had been used to. Having spent a career working as a medical practitioner, I was amazed at the knowledge the Instructors had of human anatomy and physiology, not just the musculoskeletal system but all the body systems, which of course makes them very skilled and effective Martial Artists.
  I came to Kenpo later in life but wish I had discovered it earlier, it’s true to say that Kenpo has changed and enriched my life. Now retired from work, I can devote time to teaching others of all ages and backgrounds. I run my own class and assist the other black belt instructors in running theirs.
  I particularly enjoy teaching kids, often those experiencing some form of difficulty in life, be it physical or emotional, unfortunately often as a result of bullying. It is incredibly satisfying to watch a child, overtime, transform, gain confidence, self-respect and develop into a role model for Kenpo, their school and community. I am proud to say that my family are also involved with The Kite School of Kenpo, my Daughter is a member of our governing Board of Regents, my Son is a blue belt and two of my Grandsons are purple and orange belts. I’m confident, when old enough, my other Grandchildren will also catch the Kenpo bug.
