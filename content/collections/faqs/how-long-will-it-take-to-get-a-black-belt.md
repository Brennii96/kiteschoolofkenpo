title: 'How long will it take to get a black belt?'
question: 'How long will it take to get a black belt?'
answer: "We get asked this question a lot by people of all ages. The simple answer is, if you want to do martial arts simply for a black belt, this style probably isn't for you. This is also a difficult question to answer. If you ask each of us instructors how long it took for us; we will all give very different answers. We will all give the same answer to the question “Is it worth it?” though."
