title: 'What is sparring and do I have to do it?'
question: 'What is sparring and do I have to do it?'
answer: 'Kumite (also known as freestyle or sparring) is an exercise in which students test their skills, self-confidence, and self-control in a friendly competition among other classmates. It gives the opportunity to develop their reflexes and timing in a controlled environment while engaging in a sports activity. We encourage students to get involved with sparring for various reasons, but it is a choice we donâ€™t force upon them. Whilst sparring during lessons is a choice, it is a key component of grading as it helps us as instructors determine how they are progressing.'
