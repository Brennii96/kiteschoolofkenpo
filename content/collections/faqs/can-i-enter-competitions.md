title: 'Can I enter competitions?'
question: 'Can I enter competitions?'
answer: "Kenpo Karate is a style that is designed to be effective in real-life situations, with fast and multiple strikes aimed at getting you out of a confrontation as quickly as possible. Competitions are a more sporty and less realistic way to test your abilities, where you normally stop fighting as soon as you land a strike, which means Kenpo's multiple strikes can't come into play. You can of course enter competitions if you like, but training in Kenpo Karate you are likely to be disqualified."
