title: 'Can I take photos or videos?'
question: 'Can I take photos or videos?'
answer: "No, we ask that you don't take photos or videos during class, as there may be students or parents who don't want to be recorded/pictured. You will need to get permission from our instructors, all parents, and students themselves before you are allowed to record or take pictures. As a club, we do post photos of students after getting express permission from the student and parent if the student is under 16."
