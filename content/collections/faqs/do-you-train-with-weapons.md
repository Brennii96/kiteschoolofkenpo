title: 'Do you train with weapons?'
question: 'Do you train with weapons?'
answer: "We at Kite School of Kenpo believe that confidence should be the first weapon in your arsenal. We train our students to handle themselves in real-life scenarios and since not many people carry a Bo Staff or a knife with them, we don't do much training with weapons. That being said, as you progress through the ranks and Kenpo starts becoming more natural to you, you can start training with weapons to supplement your training. Many techniques and defences against using weapons are available, which you will learn early on."
