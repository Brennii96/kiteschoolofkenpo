title: 'Are there any hidden costs?'
question: 'Are there any hidden costs?'
answer: 'At Kite School of Kenpo and all clubs associated with us, we like to keep prices as low as possible in order to spread the art of Kenpo to everyone. We charge £6 for a class, or if you bring more than one child it becomes £5 child per class. With regard to the Gi (uniform), you can purchase through us for £25, so you will get patches as well, or we can provide you with suppliers where you can purchase your own. Gradings cost £15 which includes the assessment, belt, and certification. Any profits we make as a club are put back in for things like rent, insurance, first aid, equipment, etc…'
