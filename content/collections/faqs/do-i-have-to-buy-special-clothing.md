title: 'Do I have to buy special clothing?'
question: 'Do I have to buy special clothing?'
answer: "We would recommend wearing comfortable clothing (without pockets) that you can do sport in. Whilst there's no pressure to purchase any special clothing, we would recommend it. The Gi (uniform) is made from very strong material, and it is loosely fitted to make stretching and moving around much easier. We have also noticed that children especially can feel left out when they see everyone else in class wearing a Gi."
